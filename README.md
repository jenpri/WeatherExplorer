This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

### Development Environment
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2023331/WeatherExplorer.git
cd WeatherExplorer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install
# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
